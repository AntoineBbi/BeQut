## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release. I have fixed the notes about the new submission in adding a reference about the estimation procedure used, replacing '\dontrun{}' in example by '\donttest{}', adding deviance as export function, replacing 'print()/cat()' with 'message()/warning()', and ensuring that my functions do not write by default in the user's home filespace. A big thank to the CRAN team for their check and feedback.
